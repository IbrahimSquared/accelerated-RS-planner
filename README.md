# Accelerated Reeds-Shepp Planning

Solves the Reeds-Shepp path planning problem 11.5x faster on average than OMPL's implementation. 

## Benchmarking Results

This table presents sample benchmarking results of our proposed planner against OMPL's implementation of the original Reeds-Shepp algorithm and against our implementation of [Desaulniers1995].

| Method                        | Average Time per State (Âµs) | Time Ratio to OMPL | Maximum Path Length Error | Average Path Length Error |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Proposed                      | 0.106                                         | 11.7               | 1.7e-14             | 3.31e-16            |
| [Desaulniers1995]             | 0.298                                         | 4.16               | 1.76e-14            | 2.76e-16            |
| OMPL                          | 1.241                                         | 1                  | -                         | -                         |
